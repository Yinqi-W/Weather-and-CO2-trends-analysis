<h2 style="color:#1A5276;"> Introduction: </h2>
We want to compare the weather (including the temperature and the number of rainy days) and CO2 trends of two cities located at the same latitude. So we chose Rome and Chicago. Both of them are roughly at the same latitude of 41°N. Through NOAA, I obtained the temperature and precipitation data for Chicago from 2025-1-1 to 2025-7-1, and through Visualcrossing I got the temperature and precipitation for Rome. Our hypothesis is: Since Rome is close to the Mediterranean Sea, it is warmer than Chicago, and the lower temperature city has more precipitation.

Through the data, I found the temperature in Rome is higher than Chicago, which is consistent with our hypothesis. Especially in winter (Jan-Mar), Chicago frequently falls below 0°C, even reaching nearly -20°C, While Rome remains relatively mild, mostly staying above 5-10°C. In spring, both Chicago and Rome have a significant increase in temperature, but Chicago raises more dramatically, from -5-5°C to about 10-20°C, eventually reaches 25°C. Whereas Rome steadily rises from about 13°C to 30°C.
Although both areas are located at the same latitude, their geographical environments are completely different. Rome is close to the Mediterranean Sea. The nearby sea has a high heat capacity, making it warm up and cool down slowly.
